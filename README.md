# AirAPI_Windows

This is a work in progress driver for the Nreal Air for native windows support without nebula. The current configuration for fusion has slight drift and needs to be tuned but is functional. This project is a colaberataive effort by the community to provide open access to the glasses.

This is made possible by these wonderful people:<br>

## Precompiled
To use the precompiled [AirAPI_Windows.dll](https://github.com/MSmithDev/AirAPI_Windows/releases) you also need to include hidapi.dll available [here](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases). 

[Here](https://github.com/MSmithDev/AirAPI_Windows/wiki/Using-with-Unity) is a demo in the wiki for use with unity scripts.

[Here](https://github.com/MSmithDev/AirPoseUnityDemo) is a Unity demo using the XR plugin with the Airs setup as a headset.

# Building from source

## Getting hidapi
Get the latest hidapi-win.zip from [here](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases).

unzip hidapi-win.zip to "deps" folder ("deps/hidapi-win").

cd .\vcpkg\
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
vcpkg install json-c
.\vcpkg.exe install json-c


Open the Project.sln and build the project <br>
You should have a "deps/Fusion/Fusion/Release/Fusion.lib" file.
### Build AirAPI_Windows DLL 
Open AirAPI_Windows.sln and make sure "Release" and "x64" are set and build.

Some of the code was taken from [Linux driver implementation](https://gitlab.com/TheJackiMonster/nrealAirLinuxDriver/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads).
Thanks so much, as this solves most of the issues with current implementation.
